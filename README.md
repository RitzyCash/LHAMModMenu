# LHA Mod Menu

This is a small project I started a while ago when I first attended the school, I always hated the website design and the annoying features. So this is a small Tampermonkey script that fixes those issues.


# Features
- Removed 'attend' advertising
- Custom Backgrounds
- Changed LHA Logos
- Removed 'Main Menu (Click to open) *(Who even uses this?)*
- Removed 'Switch to Mobile View button' *(Again who uses this?)*
- Edited Logout button icon to actually be a logout icon
- Added mark all bulletins as read
- Made bulletin images smaller by default
- Hidden personal info by default *(Why isnt this a feature?)*
- Font colour editing and font changing *(Kinda useless but cool)*
- Force completion for homework tasks that cannot be completed *(Why do they do this?)*

# Change Log [12/02/26]
- Fixed image scaling happening to other images off of the bulletin
- Added force completion for homework tasks that are forced incomplete
